# Lung Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit

## Description

This project predicts lung diseases using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models. Built as an educational and demo tool, it demonstrates the use of ML techniques to aid healthcare predictions. The entire project is fully implemented by me (Faiz Shaikh) with no external licenses or dependencies beyond open-source libraries.

---

## Key Features

- **Developed using Google Colab** for model training and experimentation.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks (if available).
- **Interactive Streamlit Web App:** Enables users to input patient data and receive immediate lung disease predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive form for entering symptoms and health parameters.

---

## How it Works

1. **Data Preprocessing & Training:**  
   All data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning model training are performed in Google Colab notebooks.

2. **Integration:**  
   The trained AI/ML model is exported and integrated into a Streamlit web application.

3. **Prediction Flow:**  
   - User enters symptoms and health data via the app.
   - The backend ML model processes the input.
   - The app returns a prediction about possible lung disease.

## Deployment

- The application is **hosted on Streamlit Cloud** for easy access and sharing.
- **Live Demo:**

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nexux69/Lung-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Lung-Disease-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501` by default.
